Be a part of Guardian Cities: share your ideas for what we should cover next
Two years ago, we launched the Guardian Cities website with a series of reports from six cities that had all been hit hard by natural disaster. We wanted to understand how their residents had responded to the crisis, and how successfully, or not, the cities had recovered.

It was the start of a fascinating learning curve for everyone connected with this site. Since then, we’ve reported on countless projects in cities in every corner of the planet – from an inspirational hip-hop crew in Dharavi to a transformative community centre in one of Mexico City’s most violent suburbs. Throughout, our aim has been to listen to the people who know best: those who live and work in each city we visit and report on.

And that, of course, also means listening carefully to our readers all over the world. Among much else, you have already helped us map the African city of Baraka in DRC, told us your experiences of Moscow’s regeneration, and shared stories of London’s housing crisis that appeared on billboards across the city. Every day, you keep us better informed and entertained with your contributions about the cities you love – and loathe.

Now, as we enter our third year, we’d like you to have even more of an input into the stories we cover, and the people and projects we profile. Wherever you are in the world, please take a moment to share your thoughts, ideas and suggestions using the form below.

We will read all the responses, and act on as many of them as possible. You can, of course, keep abreast of all our stories, and tell us what you think of them, on Twitter and Facebook too.

Above all, we want Guardian Cities to be a place for people who care about the future of cities to share their stories. Thank you for being part of it.

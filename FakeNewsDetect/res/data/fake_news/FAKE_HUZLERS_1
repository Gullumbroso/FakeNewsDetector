Reporters rushed to the scene to interview Mr Trump and Mr West. After being asked what they were doing in a recording studio, Kanye admitted he was working on a new single and wanted Donald Trump to be feautured in it. “Me and Donald have gotten very close in the past few days. I asked him if he wanted to be feautured in my next single, and he agreed. He’s actually a pretty good rapper”, replied Mr. West. When reporters asked Donald Trump why he had decided to get in the studio with Kanye West, Trump immediately began freestyling:

“Pull up to the scene, got you running like a candidate; AK left your suit all red, like i won the state”

After spitting the “heat”, Trump immediately jumped into the limousine that was waiting for him nearby, refusing to answer any more questions, along with Kanye West.

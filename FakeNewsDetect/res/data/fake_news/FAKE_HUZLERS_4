This Brazilian Grandma Has Been Accidentally Praying to a ‘Lord of the Rings’ Statuette
aint Anthony of Padua’s the patron saint of Brazil, Portugal, pregnant women, and the elderly. He wears brown robes, and he usually holds baby Jesus and lilies. And – as one Brazilian woman discovered – a miniature figure of Santo Antônio also vaguely looks like Elrond, the elf lord of Rivendell from Lord of the Rings. Brazilian makeup artist Gabriela Brandao made the hilarious discovery last week and posted about it on Facebook for all to see. Brandao explained that her daughter’s great-grandmother prayed to the Elrond figurine daily, erroneously believing it was Santo Antônio.

But a quick internet search found that it was actually a LOTR statuette available on eBay for less than $9. Though Gabriela posted images of the revelation on social media, there’s no word on if she broke the news to her daughter’s great-grandmother.

Update, January 6 at 2:26 p.m.: Brandão told BuzzFeed that her daughter’s great grandmother now has the correct figurine. “We tried to explain right away but she didn’t understand at first,” she said. “The next day we explained again and she understood, and we got her a new figure of Saint Anthony.”

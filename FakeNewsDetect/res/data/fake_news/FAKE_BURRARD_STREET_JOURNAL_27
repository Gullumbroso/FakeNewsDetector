Vancouver Declares State Of Emergency As Thousands Of Snowflakes Batter City
THE City of Vancouver has declared a state of emergency after nearly 1cm of snow fell, closing roads, public transport and hospitals across the region.

Hundreds, if not thousands of snowflakes battered the Lower Mainland on Sunday morning leaving millions across Metro Vancouver stranded, without power and fearing for their lives.

“Honestly we’re just lucky we’re still above ground and able to communicate with the outside world,” Mayor Robertson told the Burrard Street Journal on twitter. “Although we’re easily less than a day away from wide-scale cannibalism breaking out.”

In response to the ongoing crisis, the provinces’ of Alberta, Saskatchewan and the rest of BC, have deployed rescue helicopters to aid those in need, but as of yet have been unable to locate the crisis.

“We’re desperately searching the Lower Mainland for an area covered in snow but no luck so far,” one rescue helicopter pilot told CBC. “There is one densely populated area with no real visible snow whatsoever, but that can’t be it. I guess we’ll just keep looking.”

MENLO PARK, CA – Facebook was giving out a 502 error Friday morning to everyone trying to login to the platform because 9 000 000 people flooded their servers with the exact same status about being pregnant on April Fools’ Day.

“It’s hilarious and I’m so funny,” one woman gloated in the comment section of her status. “My mom flipped, she totally thought I was pregnant. I’m like so clever. This is the funniest thing I’ve ever done.”

A Facebook representative commented on the issue. “It’s the same thing every year. With more active users than ever, it’s gotten out of hand this time. Our servers were over heating with the same copy+paste status updates about being pregnant. We all just rolled our eyes thinking it would be over by late morning, but they just kept coming in. Things didn’t get out of hand until our servers could not keep up with the amount of praise these ladies were giving themselves in the comments. After the 9 millionth woman commented ‘GOT YOU’ as though anyone believed their lack of creativity in the first place, the servers caught on fire.”

Facebook plans to go offline completely next year.

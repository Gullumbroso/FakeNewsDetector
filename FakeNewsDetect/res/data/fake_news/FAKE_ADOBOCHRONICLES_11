CHINA LAYS CLAIM OVER MANILA’S CHINATOWN
BINONDO, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles) – Apparently not content with its claim over the disputed territory in the South China Sea, the Chinese government today announced it was laying claim over the oldest Chinatown in the world — in Manila!

Manila’s Chinatown, located in and around the Binondo district, was established in the late 1500s. It was built by the Spaniards as a settlement for Catholic Chinese, and was positioned across the Pasig River so that the colonial rulers could keep a close eye on their migrant subjects. To this day, it continues to be a center of commerce and trade in Manila where all types of businesses are run by Filipinos of Chinese ancestry.

Almost a quarter of the Philippines’ 100 Million population are of Chinese descent, and China is demanding loyalty from them.

The administration of Philippine President NoyNoy Aquino immediately protested the Chinese announcement, saying “China cannot just kidnap 25 percent of our population. What are they planning to do? Build a wall around Binondo and make our Chinatown their overseas seat of government?”

Aquino called U.S. President Barack Obama at 3 a.m. Monday morning (U.S. East Coast time) to report the latest move by the Chinese government.

The U.S. and the Philippines have a mutual defense agreement which provides for the use of Philippine bases by American military forces. In exchange, the Americans are training the Filipinos on military combat and providing military equipment to help the Philippines defend itself against foreign aggressors.

Unfortunately, Obama was out of the country attending a summit meeting of the G7 nations.

James Wright Sues Patti LaBelle for $10 Million
Viral sensation James Wright has filed a $10 million lawsuit against Patti LaBelle alleging he was due a payment for helping her market her highly sought after sweet potato pies.

Wright says LaBelle verbally agreed to pay him a set amount, but never made good on the promise. “When we spoke on the phone Mama Patti was very grateful and thankful for what my video did for her sales. She promised me she was going to cut me a really big check to show her gratitude. I guess somewhere along the lines she changed her mind. Now she isn’t even giving me credit,” stated right.

“Patti isn’t as moist as she used to be, that pie is starting to dry up,” James Wright said of their business relationship.

Wright also stated LaBelle’s recent comments, in which she took sole credit for their popularity of the pies, were “hurtful and shameful.”

“Girl, now you know those pies set on that shelf like a dog with no legs before my words made them take off like Boeing 747. I still love her, but business is business,” stated Wright.

Wal-Mart has been working tirelessly to keep up with the demand of Patti Pies. According to Fortune, the retail giant was selling “one pie per second for 72 hours straight.”

“We are working very hard with our supplier to try and produce more product,” says Kerry Robinson, vice president for bakery and deli at Wal-Mart, “We’re in the process of securing another 2 million pounds of sweet potatoes.”

The pies, which retail for $3.48, are being sold on EBay and Craigslist for $40+.

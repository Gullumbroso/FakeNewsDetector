London-Tehran tensions rise as Butlins training camp found in IranNewsBiscuit


Tensions between Iran and the UK have taken another turn for the worse after security agencies produced evidence that Butlins Redcoats are being trained at a camp on Iran’s northern borders. Describing the situation as ‘extremely worrying’, MOD officials believe Redcoats could be sent into a cabaret performance ‘within 45 minutes’.





Although the Iranian government has claimed the Butlins facility is purely for civilian use, intelligence agencies say at least five hostages have been taken from suburban areas and held there in appalling self-catering conditions.





Last week in the UK – where inciting Redcoat behaviour has been banned – a 12-month police operation came to a head when nine members of an Am-dram cell were caught planning a Celine Dion sing-a-long in the centre of Coventry. ‘These are dangerous individuals,’ said a senior police officer in charge of the sting. ‘We need the public to be vigilant if we are to stop them getting hold of a Pontin’s training manual and causing untold horror.’

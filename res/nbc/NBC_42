Call it a holiday miracle. After a two-month delay, Apple announced today that the wireless headphones are available for sale online and will begin shipping to customers next week.

The bad news: If you haven't placed your order yet, you're likely out of luck if you were hoping to get them in time for the holidays. As of Tuesday morning, the Apple website showed AirPods shipping on January 12. And stores only have limited quantities at launch, according to Apple.

Apple initially said the wireless ear buds would be available in October, but pushed the date forward so the company could spend more time perfecting the accessory.

"We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers," Apple told NBC News at the time.

AirPods, which have been the subject of countless memes for their bizarre appearance, are geared toward people purchasing the new iPhone 7, which doesn't have a traditional headphone jack.

However, they can also work with older iPhones, allowing users to ditch the headphone cord. The joy of going cordless doesn't come cheap, though.

The AirPods cost $159 and come with a charging case. Given their high price and small size, many people have mused over how long it would take before they inevitably misplace one of the AirPods.

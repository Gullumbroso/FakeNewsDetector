Metro’s Federal Triangle station will remain closed for Saturday’s Women’s March on Washington following security and logistical considerations stemming from the presidential inauguration, the transit agency announced late Friday.

Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said Transit Police made the recommendation Friday afternoon, as crews worked to break down structures from the Inauguration and clear the area for public use.

Hundreds of thousands packed the Mall for the Inauguration of President Trump on Friday, and similar crowds are expected for Saturday’s Women’s March.

Federal Triangle, just off 12th street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, was one of five stations closed for Friday’s inaugural festivities. It is the only one that is expected to remain shuttered Saturday.

Metro is advising customers to instead use Metro Center, three blocks north at 12th and F streets NW.

Federal Center SW, which is at 3rd and D streets SW, is the closest station to the march location. But because of dense crowds and potential delays, Metro is asking customers to consider walking from nearby stations such as Capitol South and L’Enfant Plaza.

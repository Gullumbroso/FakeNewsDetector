Chicago Woman Shot Over Last Patti LaBelle Pie
Patti LaBelleâ€™s ready-made Sweet Potato Pie, sold by Wal-Mart, has been flying off of grocery store shelves since a now viral video of James Wright, who is clearly a fan of the songstress, praised her culinary skills.

As the availability of the product dwindled late last night, a fight ensued over the last pie. Authorities say Rebecca Boatwright shot and wounded an unidentified 45-year-old Franklin Park woman after she refused to turn over the delectable dessert.

Fellow shoppers say Boatwright, who appeared to be under the influence, shoved the woman and demanded that she give her the pie after seeing her take the final one off the shelf. The pair argued and engaged in a shoving match with the victim claiming the spoils of the battle.

Authorities say Boatwright was enraged and waited for the unidentified victim in the parking lot. Boatwright accosted the woman at her car and again demanded that she turn over the pie. After refusing she was shot once in the leg, and Boatwright fled on foot with the pie in tow. Authorities apprehended her a short time later at a nearby park still eating the delicious delicacy.

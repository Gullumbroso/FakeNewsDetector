Dr. Love Says He is also a Lawyer and will Represent Himself
The 18-year-old who was recently arrested for posing as a doctor and opening his own clinic, also revealed that he is a lawyer and will be representing himself in his upcoming trial. Malachi Love-Robinson is facing charges of grand theft larceny, check forgery, and practicing medicine without a license.

Love-Robinson said he received his law degree when he was 15, but decided he had more of a passion for the medical field. “I got my law degree online when I was only 15, and passed the Bar a few months after. Representing myself will be no problem, and I will beat these frivolous accusations once again. I am saddened that my good name is being slandered in the media,” stated Love-Robinson. The teen was also arrested in 2015 after posing as a gynecologist.

The Palm Beach native is accused of misleading patients to believe he was a licensed medical doctor. Sitting down with ABC News, Love-Robinson continues to insist that he did nothing wrong, saying, “I have been studying this particular field for a while. It may not have been eight, nine, 10 years. It has been long enough to, I would say, justify what I do.”

Malachi Love-Robinson claims he did not state he was a medical doctor and says he is a licensed holistic practioner. He produced a certificate from the American Association of Drugless Practioners that states he has a Ph.D.

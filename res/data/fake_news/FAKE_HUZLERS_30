Chicago Bulls Drop Derrick Rose, Say He Isn’t Worth It
Empire Sports Reports:

CHICAGO — Derrick Rose, the MVP of the 2011 NBA season has been cut by the Chicago Bulls. He injured his knee back in November, and the Bulls say he is just not worth waiting for. This has every general manager in the NBA scrambling to place a claim on him.

The Miami Heat seem very interested in him, along with 18 other teams who will obviously wait for this former-superstar to heal, and then start at point guard. “I think the Chicago Bulls are idiots, absolute idiots for cutting Derrick Rose. Sure, he has been hurt a while, and is hurt again, but I think he is definitely worth waiting for. If he signs with us, he will be our starter when he comes back, I can guarantee it,” a reporter told us. Those were the words of the Miami Heat general manager. Apparently everyone wants this former-MVP.

The big 5 teams that put a claim on him were the Miami Heat, the Indiana Pacers, the Houston Rockets, the Toronto Raptors, and the Phoenix Suns. If Derrick Rose ends up going to any of those teams, he will still be in playoff talks. I never thought the Chicago Bulls would even think about cutting Derrick Rose, but apparently they have been thinking about it since his injury in November. When we finally got a chance to talk with the Bull’s general manager, this is what we collected.

“This is really shocking, and I think I speak for all of us. How long have you been thinking about this?” a reporter asked. “Well, we were really expecting big things out of Rose, and when he got injured again, we didn’t know what to do. Now the Bulls have been playing pretty well, so we just don’t think we need him any more. He is just too expensive. That’s all I will answer right now. Good bye,” the Bull’s general manager responded with.

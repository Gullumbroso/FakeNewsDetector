President Trump Attends Service at National Cathedral
The day after his swearing-in, President Donald Trump will participate in an age-old inaugural tradition.

President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence attended an interfaith prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral -- a tradition that dates back to George Washington.

A statement released from the presidential inaugural committee announced that over two dozen religious leaders from different faiths were to join the service.

"The interfaith ceremony will be in keeping with the uniting and uplifting inaugural events," the statement read.

The group of 26 leaders includes Dr. Alveda King, a niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, and Cleveland Pastor Darrell Scott, who led the National Diversity Coalition for Trump's campaign and was later named a vice chair of Trump's transition team.

Following the service, Trump is expected to visit the CIA's headquarters in Virginia along with his nominee for CIA director, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo.

“The president wants to meet with the workforce and communicate he values their service,” a government official told pool reporters today.

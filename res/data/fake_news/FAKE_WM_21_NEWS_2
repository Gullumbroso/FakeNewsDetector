ROSWELL, New Mexico – Hollywood actor Robert Downey Jr has revealed in a new interview that he is moving to Roswell, New Mexico. In the newly released interview, Downey Jr said:

“I know it sounds kind of crazy but it’s something that I’ve been thinking about for a long time. I’ve visited Roswell, New Mexico a few times over the years and the people there have always seemed like the most genuine and sincere people I think I’ve ever met and most of them had no idea who I was which is kind of a great thing sometimes, to be honest. No place is perfect but Roswell just feels like home to me and it’ll be a nice change from what I’ve been used to,” Downey Jr told the magazine.

Real estate brokers in the area were understandably excited about the news that the wealthy Hollywood actor was moving to their area and some unconfirmed reports are claiming that he already has a home picked out.

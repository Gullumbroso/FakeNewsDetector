We Scored The First One-On-One Interview With Donald Trump!
WASHINGTON, D.C. (The Adobo Chronicles, Washington Bureau) – Nothing is ordinary with President-Elect Donald Trump. Not even with regards to his relationship with the news media. He chooses whom he speaks to and has called news outlets like CNN “fake news.”

But we scored the first one-on-one interview with Trump on the eve of his inauguration as the 45th president of the United States.

AC: Congratulations, Mr. Trump

TRUMP: Call me Mr. President, or I’ll end this interview.

AC: Mr. President, we heard that you wrote your own inaugural speech. Was that difficult for you to do?

TRUMP: Nah, all it took was 140 characters.

AC: How can you outline your vision for America in 140 characters?

TRUMP: I have four years, maybe even eight, to do it every day, 140 characters at a time.

AC: What can you say about the growing number of Congress people who will boycott your inauguration?

TRUMP: Let them. They’re losers. Big losers.

AC: Are you worried at all about the fate of your Cabinet appointees?

TRUMP: If they’re not confirmed, I will still keep them in my Cabinet and personally pay their salaries. I’m rich, you know.

AC: Are you, as president, going to finally release your tax returns?

TRUMP: Only if Barack Obama releases his birth certificate. The original.

AC: Who among the current world leaders do you admire most, and why?

TRUMP: Vladimir Putin, he’s a master hacker; and Rodrigo Duterte, he’s a genius and we speak the same language.

AC: You speak Tagalog, Mr. President?

TRUMP: No, but I sure know how to curse. Those son-of-a-bitches!

AC: Why did you choose Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” as the song for you and Melania’s inaugural dance?

TRUMP: Because I can, and because I do things MY WAY.

AC: Did you know that in the Philippines, people get killed just by singing that song in karaoke bars?

TRUMP: (calls the Secret Service) Book this guy. He just threatened the president!

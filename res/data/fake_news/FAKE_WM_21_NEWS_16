Woody Harrelson Moves to Portage, Michigan, Explains Why – WM21 News
PORTAGE, Michigan – Hollywood actor Woody Harrelson has revealed in a new interview that he is moving to Portage, Michigan. In the newly released interview, Harrelson said:

“I know it sounds kind of crazy but it’s something that I’ve been thinking about for a long time. I’ve visited Portage, Michigan a few times over the years and the people there have always seemed like the most genuine and sincere people I think I’ve ever met and most of them had no idea who I was which is kind of a great thing sometimes, to be honest. No place is perfect but Portage just feels like home to me and it’ll be a nice change from what I’ve been used to,” Harrelson told the magazine.

Real estate brokers in the area were understandably excited about the news that the wealthy Hollywood actor was moving to their area and some unconfirmed reports are claiming that he already has a home picked out.

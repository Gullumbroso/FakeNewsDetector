Leah Remini Booted from Scientology for Refusing to Worship Tom Cruise
As Leah Remini releases her highly-anticipated book Troublemaker, which details her life in the church of Scientology, the famous actress revealed she was disfellowshipped for refusing to worship Tom Cruise.

“They wanted me to pray for forgiveness to Tom Cruise and that is where I drew my limits,” stated Remini. “They see Tom as this holy being who is worthy of our praise. During worship service we would get down on our knees and thank the Xenu for sending the world a savior (Tom Cruise). If you did anything against the faith you would have to seek guidance from Tom and ask him to give you direction. I woke up one day realizing how preposterous this was and had to get out.”

Remini went on to describe their book of worship as having photos and stories of Cruise granting blessings to lost souls, walking on water, turning water in wine, and plaguing non-believers with curses.

“If Tom asks you to jump, you jump no questions asked,” Remini explained. “He has the power to grant all of your wishes, or doom you to a life of turmoil. No one can be prosperous without his blessing.”

Remini also detailed weird interactions with Cruise, such as the time he tried to play hide-n-seek with Jada Pinkett Smith.

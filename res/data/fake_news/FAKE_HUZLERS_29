Rapper Gucci Mane Pleads Guilty To Gun Charges Will Serve 3 Years 3 Months In Prison!
Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane, whose real name is Radric Davis, pleaded guilty to a firearms charge today in federal court.

The 34-year-old reached an agreement with prosecutors and entered a guilty plea to the charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, according to his attorney, Drew Findling.

The charge, related to two incidents in September, carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail and a fine of up to $250,000, but prosecutors recommended that Davis be sentenced to serve three years and three months in prison. Sentencing is set for July, his attorney said.

Davis, who was indicted in November, has remained incarcerated since the September incidents, Findling said.

According to the indictment, on Sept. 12, Davis had a Taurus 45-caliber handgun and eight rounds of ammunition. Two days later, a friend concerned about the rapper’s behavior called Atlanta police.

About 1 a.m. Sept. 14, authorities found Davis walking near Moreland and East Confederate avenues, and Davis became “increasingly agitated with officers and began cursing and threatening them.”

The officers arrested Davis and discovered he was carrying a handgun and small amount of marijuana, police said at the time. The federal indictment claims he was in possession of a Glock 40-caliber handgun and 11 rounds of ammunition.

Davis was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital as a precaution.

Raven-Symoné Leaves Girlfriend AzMarie Livingston Over ‘Ghetto’ Name
Actress Raven-Symoné has split with her girlfriend AzMarie Livingston after revealing she could no longer look past her “ghetto-sounding” name. The two began dating in 2012.

“I felt like I was being a bit hypocritical,” Raven said of dating AzMarie, while admitting she has issues with ghetto-sounding names. “I just couldn’t take it anymore. For years I simply called her A.M., but she grew tired of that. I asked her to change her name if she wanted to remain in this relationship, but apparently a name is more important than being with me. It hurts but I will move on, but you better believe the next person I date will be a Sarah, Rebecca, or something that doesn’t sound like she is from some wild continent in Africa.”

“I’m in an amazing happy relationship with my partner, a woman,” Raven told Oprah during a 2014 interview for her “Where Are They Now?” specials, adding, “I am proud to be who I am and what I am. I don’t want to be labeled gay. I want to be labeled a human who loves humans. I’m tired of being labeled.”

The 29-year-old actress and The View co-host revealed her issues with ghetto-sounding names on the show, which ignited a firestorm of criticism.

Raven-Symoné made the comments after the show played video of a popular YouTube video making fun of fictional and outlandish African-American names. “Just to bring it back, can we take back ‘racist’ and say ‘discriminatory’? Because I think that’s a better word. And I am very discriminatory against words like the ones that they were saying in those names,” she said while laughing.

“I’m not about to hire you if your name is Watermelondrea. It’s just not going to happen. I’m not going to hire you,” Raven stated.

Trojan Condoms and Odell Beckham Jr. Reach Sponsorship Agreement; Will Be Featured On Future Trojan Condom Wrappers
NEW JERSEY – The Trojan brand has just announced that they will be using NFL player Odell Beckham Jr. of the New York Giants as their new Condom sponsor. The company has also announced what will be their new product slogan: “Catch it like Beckham“.

Odell Beckham has since agreed to sponsor, and be sponsored by the Trojan company. Trojan has announced that they intend to place Beckmans face on their condom wrappers to convince people even more that they can trust their products for protection. Why Beckham Jr.? Simply because of the incredible touchdown he scored against the Dallas Cowboys last night. The deal happened incredibly fast, only a half an hour after the game ended. check out the touchdown below:

Now that you’ve seen the amazing touchdown, there’s no surprise you’ll be seeing Beckham’s face on a condom wrapper before you get it going with your significant other. I think all men would rather wear a condom, which advertises itself as being as good as Beckham in catching things, than anybody else. More information on the deal is soon to come.

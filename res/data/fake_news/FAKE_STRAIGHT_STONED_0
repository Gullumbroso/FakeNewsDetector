Marijuana Users Say Newly Opened, Yet Only Half-Full Bag Of Chips Ruining Munchie High
Munchies… when you have them, nothing will stand in your way. Most of the time, you will eat anything you can get your hands on. Thanks to the munchies, I discovered that Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereal tastes AMAZING on top of a slice of cheesecake. But enough about me… The munchies are facing a huge disappointment that marijuana users say they are “tired of dealing with.”

What is it that could be pissing off even the most laid-back, chill stoner? Marijuana users say they are tired of having the munchies, opening up a brand-new bag of chips, only to be left with air and a handful of Doritos. “They’re fooling us, they’re taking our money and fooling us,” says Mitch Reynolds, semi-hourly marijuana smoker. “Sure they say they are protecting us by filling it with air so we don’t get a bag full of busted ass chips, but I say it’s a scam. So now I’ve got a by 10 bags of chips just to satisfy my munchie status? That’s f*cked up.”

A Frito-Lay consumer rep confirmed why chip bags are half filled with this statement: “Delicate items pose several challenges. Chips can be broken by rollers on the packing line or pressure from machinery that seals the bags. Extra air limits pressure on the chips when bags are stacked.”

“That’s bullsh*t,” said Reynolds. “If that’s the case, they need to make pillowcase size chip bags ’cause my ass is hungry.” Frito-Lay responded by saying they are not making pillow size chip bags. Sorry Mitch.

Updated Mayan Calendar Declares World Will Now End On Jan. 20, 2017
ALMOST 4 years after predicting the end of days in 2012, the Mayan Calendar has made what it claims to be its “final prediction” for the end of the world.

According to the latest interpretations of the ancient Mayan calendar, January 20th, 2017 will be mankind’s final day of existence, an expert on the indigenous Mexican people told MSNBC. “The Mayans are quite sure they have it right this time,” he said. “They know they said that last time but this time it’s definitely going to happen, rest assured.”

The calendar made the sudden prediction on the night of November 9th, Jose Diaz-Balart stated, after a group of elders had grown increasingly concerned of a “red mist descending from the North”.

Unlike previous occasions where apocalyptic prophecies’ were garnered from a system of ancient Mesoamerican calendars, such as the Tzolk’in and the Haab’, modern day elders have been exploring some alternative methods for making predictions, “mainly Twitter and Reddit”.

“Honestly I’ve never seen them this quietly confident about the immediate end of civilization,” Diaz-Balart explained. “They really feel they’ve nailed it this time and are mere months away from World War 3 and total armageddon.”

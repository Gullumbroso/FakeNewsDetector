Woman hits $8M jackpot, casino claims machine malfunctioned

BEAVERTON, Ore. — A woman in Oregon hit the $8 million jackpot at a Lucky Eagle Casino slot machine, but could not claim her money.

Veronica Castillo took her mother to the casino in Rochester, Washington last weekend. She put $100 in a machine and hit the jackpot — she thought.

“I was very excited, happy,” she told KOIN 6 News. “Then I couldn’t believe it.”

The casino staff came over and told her the machine malfunctioned. Veronica Castillo thought she hit the jackpot at Lucky Eagle Casino, only to be told the machine malfunctioned. Nov. 5, 2015 (KOIN)

“They shut off the machine, took it away, printed out a ticket and gave me $80.”

The casino machines have a sticker that says a malfunction of the machine voids all pays and plays.

“To me, it’s cheating, may even be fraudulent,” Castillo told KOIN 6 News. “My first thought was, how many people has this happened to? They think they won, then going away empty-handed.”

Casino CEO John Setterstrom, who has been with the casino since before it opened in 1995, told KOIN 6 News this has never happened there before. He said he is working to get answers from the manufacturer and wants to keep Castillo as a customer.

She is working to get an attorney.

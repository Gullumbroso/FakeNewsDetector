Black Teen Shot After Police Mistake Hoverboard for Machine Gun
INDIANA – The all too ridiculous contraption known as the Hoverboard lead to an all-too familiar tragedy in Gary, Indiana this week after Gary police officer and Grand Dragon of the local chapter of the Klu Klux Klan mistook a black teenager’s Hoverboard for a machine gun.

The officer, identified as Officer Sam Gatling says the teen was holding the Hoverboard in a manner that a person would hold an assault rifle and was asked repeatedly to put it down and refused to comply. He spoke with the press yesterday to address the allegations that the incident was fueled by racism. Gatling stated,

“truly, this is a tragedy, but I assure you that Gary Police protocol was followed from the very beginning. Any black male with anything that looks suspicious is to be treated as a potential threat. It’s in the book. There’s a lot of people that say that because I am a KKK member that this incident was fueled by racism. I assure you that I was merely doing my job as a police officer which has never been affected by my relationship with the order of the Klu Klux Klan which is no longer a racist organization it’s strictly to uplift the white race we don’t hate blacks.”

The officer had been placed on paid leave pending an investigation. Stay tuned as this story develops.

Empty Southern Rail train corridors to be rented out to NHSNewsBiscuit
With driver’s strikes resulting in rolling stock lying redundant, Southern Rail has come up with a new plan to help cut its losses during strike periods.

Following talks with NHS managers in the Southern Region, plans have been drawn up to temporarily convert redundant train corridors into emergency A&E admission zones to ease the pressure on hospitals and make money at the same time.

After describing the Southern Rail strike as ‘palpable nonsense’ transport secretary Chris Grayling said ‘This new initiative demonstrates how we can join forces in this difficult period and create a profitable revenue stream. I am looking forward to working with Southern rail bosses and my colleague the Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt to capitalise on a negative situation.’

Empty rolling stock will be located as close to accident and emergency units as possible and, after a thorough fumigation, will be equipped with hospital trolleys for new admissions.

One paramedic from the Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said, ‘The beauty of this scheme is that patients aren’t just abandoned in boring hospital corridors. Instead they get to go on circular tours of the southern region while they are waiting for treatment which really helps to break up the monotony of the average six hour wait to see a consultant.’

If successful the scheme will be extended to grounded British Airways planes with the benefit of low cost M&S menus available for the sick and dying.

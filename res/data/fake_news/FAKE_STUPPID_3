Businessman Wants To Eat Last Panamanian Tree Frog
Businessman Wants To Eat Last Panamanian Tree Frog

Los Angeles, CA –

This week the tear-jerking “Racing Extinction” documentary aired on the Discovery Channel. The program featured a Rabb’s Fringe-limbed Tree Frog, the very last one of its kind, which lives in captivity in a metal building called ‘Frog POD’ somewhere in the world.

See video of the frog:

While many of us who watched this segment had tears in our eyes over the tragic end of this species and so many others, one man saw the chance for a rare meal.

The film’s director, Louie Psihoyos, told Environmental New Syndicated, that he received an email this morning from a man – believed to be Malaysian tech millionaire Adil Faiquy – who said he would pay the filmmaker one million dollars for the very last remaining Fringe-limed Tree Frog.

Copy of email:

Dear Mr. Psihoyos,

I found your “Racing Extinction” documentary very touching and want to help you raise funds to get this most important film into every theater in the world.

I admit, that I enjoy eating rare and endangered animals and I’d love the pleasure of eating the last remaining Rabb’s Fringe-limbed Tree Frog.

The frog does not have a long life expectancy and is just wasting away sitting in that outbuilding having its occasional photo taken. What is it really doing at this point? Sell him to me and use the money to bring awareness to the destruction of endangered species. A million dollars buys a lot of publicity! Right!?

I will kill it humanely and eat every bit, including the intestines and its brain. No part of this cute frog will go to waste.

Please respond ASAP.

Yours truly,

A. Faiquy

It is unclear who owns the Rabb’s Fringe-limbed Tree Frog and if such an action would ever be taken. The director has yet to make a public statement on the received offer.

Woman Falls Asleep With Waist Trainer, Dies From Asphyxiation
Schaumburg, IL – Leslie Deluca, age 26, was found dead in her apartment bedroom Friday morning after falling asleep with a waist trainer.

The waist trainer was apparently way too tight, especially to fall asleep in. While being found dead in her street clothes, authorities believe she happened to fall asleep accidentally, rather than intentionally fall asleep with her waist trainer.

“This is the 10th death this week due to waist trainers” says Gayana Jefferson, an employee at the morgue where Leslie’s body has been transferred after she was pronounced dead, Doctor William Berdal says “When something is too tight around the waist for a long period of time, the normal lung capacity will greatly decrease and eventually lead to asphyxiation, very preventable, but nonetheless tragic”.

Doctors believe Leslie suffocated to death about 9 hours into her sleep. Authorities issued a warning on the hazards of waist trainers, especially falling asleep with them on. Do you actively wear a waste trainer? Be sure to take breaks from it at a maximum of 7 hours.

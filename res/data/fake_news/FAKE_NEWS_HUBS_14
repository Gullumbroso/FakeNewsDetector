Vladimir Putin Just Made A MASSIVE Donald Trump Announcement!
There are plenty of reasons to disagree with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. But unlike President Barack Obama, we know EXACTLY where Putin stands on the Islamic State (ISIS)… and under Putin’s leadership, Russia’s military has shown itself willing to kill the Islamic terrorists.

Putin sees how weak and pathetic the American president is, which is why he just made a big announcement: Vladimir Putin endorses Donald Trump for President!

From a recent press conference…

Russian President Vladimir Putin had kind words for his “stablemate” Donald Trump during an annual end-of-the-year Q&A session in Moscow. “[Donald Trump is] a really brilliant and talented person, without any doubt,” [Vladimir] Putin told reporters, according to a translation by Interfax. “It’s not our job to judge his qualities, that’s a job for American voters, but he’s the absolute leader in the presidential race.”

The GOP frontrunner has been blunt about his plans for defrosting U.S. relations with Russia should he be elected president. […] “He says he wants to move on to a new, more substantial relationship, a deeper relationship with Russia, how can we not welcome that?” he said. “Of course we welcome that.”

Clearly, Putin is ready for a bold leader in the White House that he can team up with to kill the terrorists and keep citizens of both of our nations safe.

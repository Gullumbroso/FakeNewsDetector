wVariety: Acrostic
VARIETY PUZZLE — Happy New Year, everyone! Are you all ready to start a whole new year of puzzle solving? Many thanks to the surprisingly dangerous Caitlin Lovinger for sitting in while I took a short break in the proceedings. It’s lovely to be back.

I don’t know if this has to do with my own jet lag, but I found today’s acrostic by our Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon about as difficult as any acrostic I remember doing. My only gimmes on the first read-through were ESTRAGON at entry J and DAN RATHER at entry S. Even though I’m still not sure what time zone I am in, I do remember being particularly enchanted by the clue “Vladimir’s fellow waiter onstage,” which is not a reference to restaurant servers but to the protagonists who waited interminably in Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting For Godot.”

#TodayILearned that INKY CAP mushrooms do not make a good cocktail additive (I’ll stick to olives, thank you) and that the writer Ernest HEMINGWAY liked cats with more than the usual number of toes. The next time you find yourself at a cocktail party with nothing to say to the person standing in front of you, try this as a conversation starter: “By golly, that Hemingway was an odd one, what with his polydactyl cat fetish, don’t you think? Oh, and no mushrooms in my martini, thank you ...”

A Gay Man Was Not Allowed To Sing At His Grandmother’s Catholic Funeral Because Of His Sexuality
4. Hakes told BuzzFeed News he was “completely shocked and taken aback” by the letter, as his family has been involved in the church community for generations. Hakes himself has participated in the church since he was a child.

“I attended the school that is right next door, and when I was old enough, I started to lead singing in the church. I did this for 4 years, until I went off to study Voice Performance at Indiana University Jacobs School of Music,” Hakes said.

“Religion played an important part in my upbringing and is a huge part of my family. I would definitely say I have Faith. But, to be completely honest, this entire incident has shaken it a bit. ”

Hakes has not been in contact with Pastor Lengerich, who has not responded to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment, since the funeral. But according to Hakes, Bishop Kevin Rhoades, Pastor Lengerich’s supervisor, met with his parents to personally apologize for the situation. A representative for the Diocese reached out to Hakes to apologize as well.

“I am planning to have a private meeting with the Bishop soon,” added Hakes.

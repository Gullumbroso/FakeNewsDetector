The African queen
SOMETIMES the biggest things can be the hardest to find. How else do you

explain the failure of generations of Nigerian and European archaeologists to

spot Sungbo’s Eredo, the ramparts of a thousand-year-old kingdom not an hour’s

drive from Lagos. They are very big: the earth wall and ditch are 160 kilometres

long and in places tower seven storeys high, complete with guardhouses, moats

and garrison barracks. They enclose an area the size of Greater London, or 30

times bigger than Manhattan. But it took a British geographer from the

University of Bournemouth to recognise their significance.

Patrick Darling stumbled upon Sungbo’s Eredo five years ago, when he stopped

his car along the Pan African Highway in southern Nigeria and set off on foot

into the undergrowth. What he found that day was the jewel in the African civil

engineering crown. Eredo is the most outstanding example of thousands of ancient

city ramparts and boundary embankments and ditches that Darling believes stretch

across Nigeria and much of West Africa.

Darling says that tropical landscapes are littered with ancient earthworks

that dwarf more famous ancient mega-structures such as the ruins of Great

Zimbabwe in southern Africa or the pyramids of Egypt and even compare with the

Great Wall of China. He has made it his life’s work to unlock the secrets of

these Cinderellas of the archaeological world.

Darling did not, strictly speaking, discover Sungbo’s Eredo. Local African

villagers and pilgrims knew about it all along. Eredo means a ditch, and they

believe that the earthworks were built for Bilikisu Sungbo, a fabulously wealthy

but childless widow who wanted a monument

그러면서 "수십 년간 우리나라에서 하지 못했던 일들을 해낼 것이며 변화를 약속한다"며 "많은 사람이 우리에게 기회를 주지 않았지만 우리는 무슨 일이 일어났는지 알고 있다"고 말했다.

그는 "18개월 전 이 여정을 시작했다"며 "우리는 모두 그동안 일어난 일에 질렸고 진짜 변화를 원했다"고 말했다.

트럼프는 취임식 하루 전날인 19일(현지시간) 워싱턴DC 링컨기념관에서 열린 취임 식전 행사 '환영 콘서트'에 모인 지지자 수만 명 앞에서 이같이 말했다.

미국 제45대 대통령 취임을 하루 앞둔 도널드 트럼프 당선인이 "우리나라를 통합하고, 우리 국민 모두를 위해 미국을 위대하게 만들겠다"고 밝혔다.

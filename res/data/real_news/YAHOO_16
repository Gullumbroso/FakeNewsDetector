Armstrong Williams: Trump advisers backed a more unifying inaugural speech
Conservative commentator Armstrong Williams told Yahoo News on Friday that President Trump rejected suggestions to send a more unifying message with his inauguration speech.

“Even his closest advisers felt that more should’ve been in the speech about bringing America together, about the opportunities that are available in America, also [about] the kind of country that President Obama leaves us,” Williams said. “But Mr. Trump doesn’t necessarily share that sentiment.”

During the presidential race, Williams served as the business manager and informal spokesman for Ben Carson, who ran against Trump but ultimately rallied behind Trump’s White House bid. As president-elect, Trump named Carson his choice to lead the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

In his first official speech as president of the United States, Trump offered a bleak portrayal of the current state of the country declaring, “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.”

Williams argued that Trump’s words were not only reflective of personal views, but that his refusal to amend the speech to accommodate his advisers was indicative of the newly minted president’s appeal.

“While many people might write these remarks for him and ask him to say these things, the thing that people like about Trump is the fact that he’s authentic,” said Williams. “He’s not gonna say something he does not believe.”

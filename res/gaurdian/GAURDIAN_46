The atmosphere was festive at the Oakland women’s march, where organizers estimated several tens of thousands of people took to the streets Saturday morning.

“Yesterday may have been a dark day for a lot of people, but today is just about the sun coming out,” said Tracie Noriega, an educator from Union City who marched with her daughter. “It’s hope. You need to find some optimism.”

A city with a strong protest culture, the march drew many first time marchers from around the Bay Area.

Teresa Medina, a first time protester from Pittsburgh, California, marched with a sorority sister from Sigma Lamda Gamma.

“I’m out here just to take a stand against all the hate Trump has been projecting out,” Medina said, adding that Trump’s “disrespect for Mexican immigrants” was very upsetting for her, since her mother is Mexican.

“We fought so hard not to be stereotyped,” she said. “To see other people agree with Trump was hurtful.”

Another first time protester, Z Wolt of San Leandro, said she was “disgusted” with Trump.

“He’s diminishing everyone. He’s diminishing American values,” she said.

But the Ethiopian immigrant said that she was thrilled to take part in the Woman’s March.

“I’m so proud,” she said. “I feel very connected to everyone here, like we are all one.”

Human ancestor discovery
Human ancestor discovery

It's a discovery that rocked the archaeological world -- scientists working at Moropeng, the site outside Johannesburg known as the 'Cradle of Humankind,' discovered a mass underground cave housing the remains of hundreds of individuals that the researchers say belong to a new species of the human family. Researchers named the creature Homo naledi. That reflects the "Homo" evolutionary group, which includes modern people and our closest extinct relatives, and the word for "star" in a local language. The find was made in the Rising Star cave system.

On Friday, tens of thousands of women made their way to the Women’s March on Washington, D.C. to protest the election of president Donald Trump.

Their journeys to the event — and some of the sister marches planned in all 50 states and six continents across the world — took over social media, with their large crowds becoming a symbol of sisterhood and solidarity.

One video of a Spirit Airlines flight attendant speaking to a plane full of attendees quickly became a viral hit. In it, she addresses the passengers upon arrival in nearby Baltimore — and provides them with an inspiring message of solidarity.

“I just want to know how many of you are going to the march on Washington?” she asks them, to the cheers of nearly the whole flight. “Big round of applause for all the nasty women on board. Stay safe, stay hydrated, have a good time, watch out for your fellow sisters. Just remember — we don’t take no ‘ish from no man.”

Here are some of the other inspiring images that flooded social media.

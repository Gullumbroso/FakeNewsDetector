Seth Meyers jokes Donald Trump inauguration will end with impeachment
Donald Trump is officially being sworn in as president of the United States on Friday. He does so with record low approval ratings — perhaps one of the reasons he’s had so much trouble booking marquee talent for his inauguration festivities. As Seth Meyers noted in his A Closer Look at Trump’s inauguration on Thursday night, Trump’s team reportedly even offered ambassadorships to anyone who could book big-name performers.

“If that were the case, you can bet Chris Christie would be cold-calling everyone in the Los Angeles phone book,” Meyers joked. “‘Please, Rihanna, if you do this, I could be ambassador to Chile, and I love Chili’s!'”

Star-studded inauguration or no, Trump will still enter office with a few clouds hanging over his reputation — both the continuing allegations that the Russian government interfered on his behalf during the campaign and the fact that he still has not divested from his private businesses. According to some legal scholars, the latter is in violation of the Constitution.

“I guess that explains the schedule,” Meyers said. “Noon swearing-in, 3 p.m. inaugural parade, 6 p.m. impeachment hearing.”

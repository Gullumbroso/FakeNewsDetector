PINJARRA, AUSTRALIA – Federal agents have arrested more than 40 people from a privately owned petting zoo yesterday, over allegations of bestiality and animal cruelty.

According to authorities the private petting zoo was being monitored for last few weeks; suspected for running a underground animal brothel, where customers/clients pay for s*xual services with animals.

The 67-year old farm owner was arrested with two of his sons and some 40 guests who were present for an all-night party.

The Federal police caught all the party goers in full action; the raid engaged more than 16 agents in what local officials believe to be the biggest crack down on an animal cruelty in Australia’s history.

Local authorities fear a recrudescence in s*xual deviant behavior with animals in the region since this is the third animal brothel to be closed down in recent months in the area.

Psychologist Dane Banff said :

We can’t explain why humans wants to do strange things to animals; But if human beings unleash their wildest fantasies in such a context, even though illegal, might prevent such abuses as r*pe from being committed. But at the same time, having se*ual relations with koalas and other animals is not considered to be a healthy behavior and should not be encouraged – she acknowledges.

The farmer and his sons could face up to five years in prison expect legal experts.

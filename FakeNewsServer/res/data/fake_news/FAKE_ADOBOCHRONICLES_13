James Taylor To Perform At Donald Trump’s Inauguration
WASHINGTON, D.C. (The Adobo Chronicles, Washington Bureau) – Just hours after American singer-songwriter James Taylor announced that he had cancelled a scheduled concert in the Philippines, he confirmed with The Adobo Chronicles that he had accepted an invitation from the Donald Trump inaugural committee to perform during the president-elect’s inauguration.

The inaugural committee has had a very difficult time booking artists and performers for the January 20 event. No one wanted to be associated with the Trump inaugural.

Taylor’s acceptance comes as a big relief for Trump. The president-elect tweeted his appreciation for the 70’s folk singer who, incidentally, is a known Democrat.

Taylor cancelled his Manila concert scheduled in February, claiming that it was in protest of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs and the alleged extra-judicial killings that prompted his withdrawal from his Philippines appearance.

Many believe, however, that the real reason Taylor cancelled was because of dismal ticket sales.

'Spider-Man' Reboot: Justin Bieber to Play Spider-Man In Upcoming Films


Amazing Spider Man 3, or, another potential reboot of Spider-Man has come out with another twist in its tale. The movie has been hanging on a thin wire for some time now and finally it looks like we are getting our confirmations.

With the signing of the agreement between Sony Entertainment and Marvel Studios, it was well speculated that Amazing Spider Man 3 is not going to see the day light. This also implies the fact that Andrew Garfield will not wear the webbed costume once again to climb on the wall. The part of Spider-Man will be played by none other than singer Justin Bieber.

Chief of Sony Entertainment, Kaz Hirai announced earlier today that Sony and Justin Bieber came to an agreement in which Justin Bieber will play Spider-Man for the next film, a brand new Spider-Man reboot. “He’s perfect for Peter Parker, he’s young, a loser, and looks like a nerd with glasses on. On top of that, he has so many fans who we expect to be buying tickets to see him in action as Spider-Man.” said Kaz Hirai to HUZLERS reporters.

Sony even decided to have a photo shoot where pictures of Justin Bieber in a Spider-Man suit would be taken (Picture above). How do you feel about Justin Bieber playing Spider-Man? Tweet your opinion with the hashtag #SpiderJustin on Twitter.

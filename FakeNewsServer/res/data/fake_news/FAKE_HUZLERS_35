**BREAKING NEWS** DNA Test Reveals Kanye West Is Not The Father Of North West
LOS ANGELES – Rap star Kanye West revealed to not be the actual Father of Kim Kardashian’s daughter North West. North West was born on June 15, 2013 and since then it was believed that Kanye West was the father, however, a recent DNA test on Sunday has proven that the baby is not Wests’. Kanye West told Kim Kardashian that he wanted North West to take a DNA test after the girl was apparently found listening to rapper LIL B’s music.

Kanye West told reporters “I knew there was something wrong with her since the beginning, she ugly as f*ck compared to me when I was a baby and that’s unacceptable, and me and Kim never listen to Lil B, how did she know who he was? And she ain’t even Ralph anyways” Kanye then appeared to have a sudden realization as he stormed away from the reporters angrily.

Kim Kardashian refused to talk to the media and reporters after the revelation. Experts are trying to figure out who the true biological father of North West is as Kanye ordered. Kanye also said “As soon as I found out who the father is, I’ll sacrifice his a*s”. Experts have said that the father will most likely be legendary rapper LIL B, and also believe that Kim Kardashian and North West have been seeing LIL B behind Kanye’s back, which would explain the girl’s exposure to LIL B’s legendary music. The thought of LIL B being North West’s father is beginning to make even more sense in the past few days after LIL B tweeted:

We can only imagine the drama that is about to come if LIL B is in fact the father of North West. Reporters are standing by for more information; we will keep you updated.

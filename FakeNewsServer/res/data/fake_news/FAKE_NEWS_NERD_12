Dame Dash Says Cousin Stacey Dash To Run for President
Hip Hop mogul Dame Dash says his controversial cousin Stacey Dash is gearing up for a presidential run in 2020.

Billboard caught up with the former Roc-a-Fella Records executive, who revealed that the recent controversial statements by his cousin are intentional.

“There is a method to her madness, ” Dame revealed. “Over the years she’s witnessed the success of Trump and other political figures who were controversial, and thought she could lend a voice to the movement. She figures the more controversial she is, the more press she will receive. And it’s all for political gain and brownie points with far right conservatives, who love to hear blacks repeating their rhetoric.”

“She’s told majority of our family about her desires to become President of the United States, and plans to bring on Sarah Palin as her VP. We all just laughed and thought about all the crazy that would be on that ticket. We’ve all pretty much disowned her at this point as she’s alienated herself from the family with her ridiculousness.”

“Clueless” actress Stacey Dash recently made headlines when she suggested we do away with BET and Black History Month. The Fox News contributor stated: “We have to make up our minds. Either we want to have segregation or integration. And if we don’t want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like B.E.T. and the B.E.T. Awards and the Image Awards where you’re only awarded if you’re black. If it were the other way around, we would be up in arms. It’s a double standard.”

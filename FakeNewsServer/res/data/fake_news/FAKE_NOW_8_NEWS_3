[VIDEO] Girl Drowns While Doing The New #CondomChallenge
News 8 – A new, dangerous trend has just hit the Internet and it’s already taken the life of a young teenager. We’ve had the ghost pepper challenge, the ice bucket challenge, the cinnamon challenge… and the list goes on. Now, the latest viral craze involves filling a condom with water and dropping it on your friend’s head.

It’s called the #CondomChallenge, and the object of the challenge is for the condom not to break, but bulge over the head. It is supposed to cause a hilarious illusion of a bulbous face of the presumably willing victim. However, if the condom does not break, the participant is at risk for suffocation. That’s what happened to 17-year-old Lily Messinger.

When Lily began the challenge, her friend filled up a condom with water and held it over her head. As you can see in the video below, her friend, Casey, drops the condom with force as it wraps around Lily’s head with the water still in place. “After I dropped it over her head we were all just cracking up,” said Casey. “Then our friend started yelling ‘she can’t breathe!’ That’s when someone ran in to try to get the condom off of her head, but it was on so tight and it would not break. She literally drowned to death inside of a condom. And it’s all my fault. I will never forgive myself.”

After about 15 minutes of CPR given by Lily’s friends, the ambulance arrived and pronounced her dead at the scene. Casey wants to let everybody know it’s not worth it, “Don’t get involved in these stupid trends on the Internet. It might look fun at first, but this is just as deadly as that stupid Ice Bucket Challenge from last year.” Make sure to let everyone know how dangerous this new trend is. You just might save a life.

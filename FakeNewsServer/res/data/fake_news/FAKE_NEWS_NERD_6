Man on Hoverboard Arrested for Driving on a Suspended License
MARIETTA – An Atlanta area man was arrested for driving on suspended license after being pulled over on his hoverboard. Cobb County Police say Vincent Williams operated a “motor vehicle” on a roadway, while knowing his license was suspended.

A law went into effect in Cobb County, GA in January which requires hoverboard operators to have a driver’s license, insurance, and must also register the vehicle. Hoverboard operators must also be at least 16-years-old and cannot be intoxicated in any manner.

California also passed similar legislation with the exception of requiring a driver’s license. The law offers the first legitimate definition of a “hoverboard,” which is alluded to as an “electronically mechanized skateboard” under the law. It likewise makes hoverboards legal or illegal in certain areas.

This was Williams’ third arrest for operating a motor vehicle without a license. He was denied bond until his court date, which is more than a month away.

Many Cobb County residents called the law “ridiculous”, stating the local government is overstepping its boundaries and purposely passing legislation to regulate how the public lives their lives.

Cobb County resident John Bethancourt says he bought all three of his children hoverboards for Christmas and his family has absolutely no plans to follow this law.

“This law is silly, unnecessary, and just another pointless government regulation,” stated Bethancourt. “Let’s just call it what it really is — another tax. My kids love riding their hoverboards around the neighborhood, and I will continue to let them do so. If the government, or anyone else, wants to deny my children that right, they can come reimburse me the money I spent.”

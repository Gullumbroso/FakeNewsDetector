The above chart is for summary purposes only. For complete details, check the "How to Play" instructions on the Website/App ("Game Instructions"), which are made a part of these Official Rules and incorporated herein by reference. In the event of any inconsistency between these Official Rules and the Game Instructions, these Official Rules will prevail, govern and control with the sole exception of the award of points for the completion of predictions/answers; with regard to the award of points for the completion of predictions/answers only, the Game Instructions will prevail, govern and control.

The Website/App form will indicate if your predictions have been saved. You may return and modify your predictions/answers as many times as you wish before the applicable end date/time (see chart in Section 4), except for the Season Long Predictions, which must be submitted by 1/16/17 at 4:59 p.m. PT . The version of your predictions/answers on the Website/App at the end of the applicable Weekly Game Period (and for the Season Long Predictions, at 4:59 p.m. PT on 1/16/17), per the chart above, as per Sponsor's records, will be considered your predictions for potential points/entries during that Sweepstakes Game Period.

EACH ENTRANT MAY SUBMIT ONE (1) SET OF PREDICTIONS/ANSWERS PER SWEEPSTAKES GAME PERIOD, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS HE/SHE MAY HAVE.

By entering this Sweepstakes, participants agree to these Official Rules and the decisions of the judges and Sponsor, which are binding and final in all matters relating to this Sweepstakes.

ABOUT POINTS: Sponsor or its designees shall determine in their sole discretion whether an entrant submitted one or more correct Season Long Predictions, as well whether an entrant correctly answered the Weekly Trivia/Bonus questions (as applicable) so as to receive points (and, if so, the number of points to be awarded based on number of correct predictions/answers); such decisions are final and binding in all respects and not subject to appeal. Points are usable only by Sponsor and Administrator for internal purposes of conducting the random drawings as set forth in these Official Rules and participants have no ownership or property rights in points. Without limiting the foregoing, any attempt by a participant to sell, purchase, and trade or exchange points is void. Such actions (as well as any other action which seeks to defraud Sponsor or Administrator in conjunction with the acquisition or use of points) will result in points not being honored and disqualification from the Promotion.

7. LEADERBOARD/GROUPS: The Leaderboard and groups are for entertainment purposes only. Joining a group(s) (private or public) is optional; you may join as many groups as you'd like to compare your points/predictions with other Members. If you choose to join a group(s), once your picks are locked, they will be applied across all your groups.

The Leaderboard posted on the Website/App is intended to reflect the point values of players (for a given week and/or cumulatively over the course of the Promotion Period). The Leaderboard may take up to twelve (12) hours to accurately reflect all activities completed. Sponsor/Administrator will endeavor to maintain and accurately reflect the number of points that participants have earned (both overall and for specific Weekly Game Periods). However, Sponsor and its agencies (including Administrator) shall not be responsible for technical errors of any kind which may cause inaccurate or incomplete information to be reflected at any given time. Sponsor/Administrator may update the Leaderboard (including a given participant's point total) at time(s) of their sole choosing and Sponsor/Administrator may correct erroneous listings on the Leaderboard (including a given participant's point total) at any time in their sole discretion without liability or notice of any kind.

During the Promotion Period, each point accumulated by an entrant will result in one (1) entry into the applicable Sweepstakes Game Period. Each point obtained by an entrant during a Weekly Game Period will result in an entry into both that Weekly Game Period drawing and the Grand Prize drawing at the end of the Promotion Period. For the avoidance of doubt, non-winning entries from a given Weekly Game Period will not be carried over into the following Weekly Game Period. Sponsor and/or Administrator will determine, in its/their sole discretion, which entries are deemed eligible entries, and their decisions and the results of the drawings will be final in all respects.

Mark Gastineau, one of the most feared pass-rushers of the 1980s who helped anchor the Jets’ famed “New York Sack Exchange” defensive line, announced Thursday he is suffering from dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease — the result he says of the hits he delivered and took during his 10-year NFL career.

“You know, my first reaction was that I didn’t believe it. I couldn’t believe it,” Gastineau told the New York Daily News in an interview Thursday night. “My second reaction was how can I help other people coming into the NFL? That’s what it’s all about.”

Selected in the second round of the 1979 NFL draft out of tiny East Central Oklahoma State, Gastineau became renowned for his quarterback hits even before sacks became an official NFL stat in 1982. The year before, he had 20 unofficial sacks on a defensive line that also included Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and Abdul Salaam and produced 66 of them, helping the Jets make the playoffs for the first time since 1969. Gastineau would make the Pro Bowl in five straight seasons from 1981 to 1985 and had 107 1/2 sacks in the first 100 games of his career, his dancing post-sack celebrations garnering much notice and eventually getting banned by the NFL after a brawl broke out in a game between the Jets and Rams in 1983.

Gastineau, 60, now works with USA Football’s Heads Up Football program to promote safer tackling techniques.

“I know that there’s techniques out there that if I would have had ‘em, if I would have had the techniques out there that I’m teaching now to these kids, I know I would not be probably . . . I know I wouldn’t have the results that I have now,” he told WOR radio on Thursday (via the Daily News).

“I led with my head all the time.”

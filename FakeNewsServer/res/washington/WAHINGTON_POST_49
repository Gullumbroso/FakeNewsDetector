The best places to eat within walking distance of the National Mall

Imagine you've been roaming the National Mall for hours, when America's front yard can feel like America's front line, and your kids suddenly hit the wall. Not the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall, but the invisible wall of hunger, the one that leaves young ones crankier than a one-eyed purple Minion hankering for a banana.

Now imagine you don’t have bottled water or Goldfish snacks to calm your savage preteen. Where near the vast Mall would you turn, when even a short walk with a famished child can feel like a Lewis and Clark expedition over the Great Divide? The Mall, after all, is a contradictory landscape: It's packed with food options, most of which reveal nothing about the D.C. scene.

Sure, you could duck into the National Air and Space Museum and quiet those rumbling tummies with a Happy Meal from McDonald's in the Wright Place Food Court. Or you could follow our advice.

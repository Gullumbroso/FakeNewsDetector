Man, 24, is shot three times with a tribal bow and arrow
A man was forced to travel 155 miles across India with three huge arrows in his body after an argument with his brother.

One of the metal-tipped arrows narrowly missed 24-year-old Mansiya Marai's heart.

His older brother Tala fired a traditional bow and arrow at him in the village of Alirajpur, Madhya Pradesh after a dispute over some property boiled over.

Mansiya Marai arrived in the hospital with the arrow embedded in his chest (pictured, left). The surgeon said if he had tried to pull it out it would have ruptured his internal organs

One of the spears pierced his abdomen injuring his intestines, while the second pieced his chest, narrowly missing his heart and ending up in his stomach.

A third arrow was impaled through his hand but he pulled it out himself.

Mr Marai was taken to a local hospital along bumpy roads in a three-wheeled rickshaw but then had to be transferred by ambulance to a specialist hospital in the city of Indore.

Mansiya Marai is recovering in hospital in Indore after undergoing four hours of surgery

He eventually underwent more than four hours of surgery.

Mr Marai, who is part of a tribal community, is recovering in hospital and police plan to arrest his brother for attempted murder.

Dr Manish Kaushal, who operated on him at Maharaja Yashwantrao Hospital, said: 'We were shocked to see the patient when he arrived at the hospital with arrows lodged in his chest and abdomen.

'Luckily, the patient or their relatives didn't try to pull out the two arrows that had gone deep inside his body.'

He said: 'Any attempt of pulling out the arrows would have ruptured the intestines or injured other vital organs.

'We are happy to inform that the operation has been successful and the patient's life is out of danger.'

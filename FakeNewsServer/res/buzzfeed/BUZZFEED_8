10 Life-Changing Things To Try In December
There are a lot of location-tracking gizmos around: minimalist ones, ones for your wallet, ones for your kids. Tile is one of the first and most successful trackers, which is why I wanted to try it for myself. It’s a small plastic square that connects to an iPhone or Android device via Bluetooth and can reveal an item’s location up to 100 feet away by triggering a loud tone or show the item’s last known location on a map.

The most obvious place to put Tile is a key ring, although you could technically attach it to anything (your car, luggage, wallet, bike, etc.). I tested the second-generation Tile, which has an updated ringer that’s even louder than before (apparently the loudest on the market). It definitely came in handy when my keys were buried in jean pockets at the bottom of my dirty clothes heap.

The app and web app are very easy to use. They show the location of your Tile (or Tiles) and your phone, plus a “Find” button to ring Tile’s alarm. Because Tile’s location is synced to your account, you can log into Tile from any computer or phone and see where both your phone and Tile are. Another great feature is being able to reverse-find your phone by double pressing the “e” in Tile. You can also share Tiles, which is great for roommates with a single mail key, for example.

One major downside to Tile is that its battery lasts one year and it cannot be replaced. After 11 months, you have to “re-Tile” for about half the original price, $12. But this isn’t so bad — you could just gift the Tile for that person who’s too busy to remember where their shit is, year after year after year. —Nicole Nguyen

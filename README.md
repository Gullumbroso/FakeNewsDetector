# FakeNewsDetector

A project for trying to identify fake news articles via machine learning. The objective was to examine the possibilites of machine learning as a tool for fighting misinformation in the digital world. 

The final project: http://gullumbroso.pythonanywhere.com/fakenews/

The model was trained on 452 fake articles taken from more than 60 fake news websites, and 452 real articles from news sites like Times, CNN, Fox News and more. The vectorization was performed using the "Bag of Words" technique - turning words frequencies in the articles into feature vectors. The classification was preformed by SGD.

6-year-old immigration activist wins hearts at Women’s March
Sophie Cruz, a 6-year-old immigration activist and daughter of two undocumented immigrants, spoke at the Women’s March on Washington on Saturday and won over the crowd with her inspiring message. After delivering her speech in English, she repeated it in Spanish and led the crowd in a rousing chant of “Si, se puede,” or “Yes, we can.”

Social media exploded with support for Cruz, who initially attracted attention when she slipped through security barricades to reach Pope Francis during a procession when he visited the U.S. in 2015. She handed the pope a letter about immigration reform, in which she expressed her fear that her parents would be deported.

“We are here together making a chain of love to protect our families,” Cruz said during her Saturday remarks. “Let us fight with love, faith and courage so that our families will not be destroyed.

“I also want to tell the children not to be afraid, because we are not alone,” Cruz continued. “There are still many people that have their hearts filled with love.”

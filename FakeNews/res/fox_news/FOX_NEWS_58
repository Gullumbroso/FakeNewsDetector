Pro Football Hall of Famer Bruce Matthews Details His Life On & Off the Field in New Book
Hall of Fame offensive lineman Bruce Matthews spent 19 seasons playing for the Houston Oilers and Tennessee Titans. Matthews is one of the few players to stay with a franchise for 19 years. Matthews’ family comes from a long line of current and former football players, including Clay Matthews of the Packers and Jake Matthews of the Falcons, both will be playing each other Sunday in the NFC Championship game with a chance to go to the Super Bowl.

Matthews has a new book out called “INSIDE THE NFL’S FIRST FAMILY: My Life of Football, Faith and Fatherhood” and the book details his great pro career, including blocking for fellow Hall of Famer, quarterback Warren Moon, the highs and lows of his playing career and making it to Super Bowl 34 to see his team fall a yard short of tying the game with six seconds left against the St. Louis Rams in 2000.

Matthews talks with FOX News Radio’s Tommy Byrne about the book and his playing career. Matthews also talks about this weekend’s NFC & AFC title games:

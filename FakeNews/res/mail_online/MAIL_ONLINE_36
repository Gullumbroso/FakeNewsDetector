Ethereal photos capture famous landmarks after the snow has driven tourists away
As winter sprinkles its white dust over large swathes of the world, locals hunker down while tourists tend to flee in search of warmer regions.

For some popular landmarks, this means a welcome break from the heaving crowds.

Not many would think to explore Rome's ancient Colosseum during the bleak midwinter, for example, but you could say it looks even more magical sitting quietly under a dusting of snow.

When it comes to nature spots - take California's Yosemite, or New Zealand's Tongariro National Park - many are more famed as summer hiking spots, but boast views in winter which are well worth wrapping up for.

And if you've always wanted to wander along the Great Wall of China, but are put off by the steady influx of other tourists, perhaps consider making the trip when the cold weather hits.

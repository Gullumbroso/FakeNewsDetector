Lacrosse days a distant memory for Patriots standout Hogan

Jan 22 (Reuters) - Chris Hogan has come a long way since his college lacrosse days and the New England Patriots are grateful after the wide receiver set a franchise playoff mark with 180 receiving yards against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The 28-year-old from Connecticut caught nine passes and scored two touchdowns, the second of them on a 34-yard flea flicker from quarterback Tom Brady, to help New England complete a 36-17 win on Sunday that earned them a spot in the Super Bowl.

For Hogan, who was signed by the Patriots as a free agent in March last year after head coach Bill Belichick described him as a "burner" with extraordinary athleticism, it was simply the latest chance for him to make the most of opportunities.

"I just want to be able to take advantage of all the opportunities that I get," Hogan told the NFL Network. "Playing in my first championship game, the ball came my way a couple of times and I was able to make the most of it."

Asked what he would have said had he been told seven years ago that he would be playing for the Patriots in Super Bowl 51, Hogan replied with a grin: "No."

He was ready, however, to give his former lacrosse team mates from Penn State tickets for the Super Bowl clash against the Atlanta Falcons, to be played on Feb. 5 in Houston.

"I'm sure they will be hitting up my phone this entire week (asking for tickets)," said Hogan. "It will be crazy. A bunch of them are here right now so it will be fun just to see them and celebrate with them."

Belichick, who has coached the Patriots to seven Super Bowl appearances, applauded Hogan's record-setting display against the Steelers.

"Chris has done a good job for us all year," Belichick said about the wide receiver who was lured from the Buffalo Bills on a three-year deal worth $12 million. "He's a good player. He does a lot of things well and he's fast.

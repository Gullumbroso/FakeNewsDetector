NEW YORK, NY – After years of protest over its racist team names, Major League Baseball is finally forcing the Chicago ‘White’ Sox to find a less offensive, racially insensitive title.

“I’ve always been offended by the term White Sox,” states an angry white baseball fan after seeing Bomani Jones wearing a ‘Caucasians’ tshirt on ESPN. “Spelling it ‘Sox’ implies we are too busy with our six-figure jobs to add the extra letters to spell it properly. And yes, we get it. Us white people like to wear socks in sandals because we can afford both socks and sandals. Awful.”

Major League Baseball created a list of names acceptable for the Chicago franchise to change its team name to that doesn’t offend any white people:

Chicago Moon Crickets

Chicago Spooks

Chicago Jigaboos

Chicago Porch Monkeys

Chicago Zipperheads

Chicago Cactus Chuckers

Chicago Wetbacks

Chicago Camel Jockeys

Chicago Tar Babies

Chicago Prairie Chickens

Chicago Gooks

Chicago Flatroofers

Chicago Jungle Monkey

Chicago Wagon Burners

Chicago Redskins

Chicago Braves

Chicago Indians

MLB stated they don’t want to end up like Chris Rock, who was forced to pay $1 million to a white family offended by his use of the ‘N-word’.

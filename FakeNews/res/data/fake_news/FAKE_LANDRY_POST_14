Harrison Ford Involved in Bar Fight in Omaha, Nebraska – Landry Post
OMAHA, Nebraska – Patrons at a downtown bar in Omaha, Nebraska were surprised to see Hollywood actor Harrison Ford walk in late last night but even more surprised just a short time afterwards when a man approached him and began to loudly berate him and then attack him. Lauren Kelleher, who watched the entire event unfold, described the scene:

“Everyone noticed Harrison when he came in including the guy who attacked him and within a few minutes the guy goes over there and starts yelling at him. Pretty sure the guy was wasted and then Harrison yells something back at him and the guy lunges toward him and grabs his neck. Luckily, there were a couple of guys sitting at the bar watching the whole thing who then tackled the guy and held him down until police arrived. It was definitely the craziest thing I’ve ever seen in my life for sure. But Harrison was so nice to everyone afterwards and had a lot of nice things to say about Omaha. It was such a shame that he was treated like that! I hope he comes back!”

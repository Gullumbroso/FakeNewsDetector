Matt Damon Had This to Say About the Residents of Grand Island, Nebraska – WM21 News
GRAND ISLAND, Nebraska – During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Matt Damon took a moment to praise Grand Island, Nebraska residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently:

“We were just leaving the city limits of Grand Island, Nebraska when I noticed that we had a flat tire so I pulled over to the side of the road and we were about to call the car company but then just a minute or two later there were two, maybe three cars that pulled over behind us and offered to put the spare on. So I let them. I mean, I was just so impressed that people could be that friendly to pull over so quickly and offer to help a complete stranger. You have to understand that this is something that would’ve never happened in L.A.!” Damon said with a laugh.

He added later, “And they had no idea who I was before they pulled over. So yeah, that’s my story about Grand Island. It’s nice to know that there are still places like this in America.”

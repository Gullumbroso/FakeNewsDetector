BREAKING: Man Planning to KILL Trump Was Hillary Clinton’s Close Friend! His Plan is SICK…
A man named Dominic Puopolo was arrested by Miami Beach police Tuesday, for public threatening the President-elect Donald Trump. Dominic showed his intention via Twitter video where he announces that he will kill Donald Trump.

Here are Dominic’s not-wise words,

“This is the 16th of January 2017, I will be at the review/ inauguration and I will kill President Trump, President-elect Trump today.”

According to confident sources, this man is a close family friend with Clintons. His very close connections to Clinton are shown public where Hillary gave a eulogy for his mom when she died during the 9/11 attacks.

Their special relationship is exposed in many pictures taken together, and as Liberty Writers reports, he once gave $20,000 to the Democratic National Committee.

Trump is scheduled to be sworn in Friday in Washington, D.C. as Puopolo remains incarcerated on a charge of threatening to harm a public servant.

However, this is not time for Dominic to be arrested. In Miami he was arrested four times for petty crimes, in the last 10 years. His criminal record reads, two times arrested for petty theft and once for defrauding an innkeeper.

Puopolo, however, may not be the average Trump hater. On various social media platforms, where he posts as JesusChrist1701, the computer consultant claims to have testified in terror cases as an expert witness in a German federal court in Hamburg from 2003 to 2008, writes Daily Mail.

This is a very serious issue, and it should be investigated ASAP. We can’t allow every idiot to make public threats to public servants. We should make an example of him and show the others that they can’t be messing around.

Let’s share this everywhere and expose this sick plan!

1 Hour After being Released Jeremy Meek Was Killed By His Wife
Stockton, CA – According to jail records, Jeremy Meek was released from jail just before midnight on Tuesday night. About an hour later, just before 1 a.m. on Wednesday morning, Stockton Police found him laying in the road in the area of Dayton and West in Central Stockton. He was taken to Community Regional Medical Center where he died from his wounds shortly after arriving.

During the investigation, police said Meek went to his mother’s house after leaving the jail and got into a fight with his wife. Police said Meek and his wife Lashanda Meek had longstanding personal issues. They said the fight ended with Meek laying in the road with two wounds — one they said, looked like a knife wound, the other may be a gunshot wound. Witnesses also reported a loud pop. An autopsy is scheduled for Friday.

Police caught Lashanda Meek on the run about a mile away from the murder scene at an apartment complex. Officers served a search warrant there looking for evidence and they also towed a minivan, which they believe was the getaway vehicle. Stocktown Police Chief Tom Morris said investigators seized a gun at the home where Jeremys wife Lashanda Meek was arrested.

Morris said Lashanda Meek is being treated for injuries at Community Regional Medical Center, and will face murder charges once she is booked into the Stocktown County Jail.

Mother Sues Netflix After "Netflix N Chill" Session Resulted In Her Daughter's Pregnancy
ST LOUIS – Veronica Brown, the mother of 16 year old Andrea Brown, has reportedly filed a lawsuit against Netflix after claiming a “Netflix N Chill” session is to blame for her daughter’s pregnancy.

16 year old Andrea Brown is now pregnant after falling victim to a Netflix N Chill date. Her Mother is suing Netflix for $50,000, claiming that teenagers like her daughter are extremely prone to sexual intercourse when watching Netflix, and because of that, Netflix is to blame for the pregnancy.

“It happened like you thought it did” said Andrea, “First, we were just watching a movie on Netflix and then all of a sudden there was a p*nis in my mouth. Then from there we had sex and he didn’t pull out. It’s like Netflix intentionally makes their movies boring so that one can fall into this trap. That’s why my mom is suing” finished Andrea.

Netflix has not yet responded to the lawsuit, but are expected to within the next few days. Experts are also advising people to cancel their Netflix subscriptions and to subscribe to Hulu instead. “73% of ‘Netflix N Chill’ dates lead to sexual intercourse, while only 12% of ‘Hulu N Chill’ dates lead to sexual intercourse”, says Psychiatrist Ana Jennings, “Something has to be done”.

Andrea’s baby is expected to be born next March. For more updates on the Netflix lawsuit, subscribe to huzlers.com for email notifications. Don’t forget to visit our new clothing store MarvelousAttire.com!

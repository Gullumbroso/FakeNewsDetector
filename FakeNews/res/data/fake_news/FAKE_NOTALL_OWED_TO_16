This is 19-year-old Jacqueline Arguello and her dog, Mocca, from Pharr, Texas. Mocca recently met the love of her life* and together they had babies.

Mocca recently gave birth to a litter of adorable, healthy pups. However, Arguello and her family were confused when one after another, the puppies came out with different, dark shades of fur.

“When I saw her first baby be born, I thought it was funny that [the baby] was black,” she told reporters. “And then the next one was black, and the next, and the next!” she recalled.

Arguello started speculating if Mocca had snuck out and bred with another dog somehow. As far as the Arguellos knew, the poodle whom Mocca met and fell in love with* was the first dog she’s ever had contact with.

“But here they are playing together and appearing to fall in love. He was the only dog we let her be around, so we knew he was the baby daddy” she explained. “About two weeks later, she was pregnant. And because both dogs had light-colored fur, she expected “super white puppies.”

Arguello joked about the idea that Mocca possibly stepped out on her beau and was impregnated by another baby daddy by tweeting a scene from the show Maury. Her tweet has been retweeted nearly 50,000 times.

“I’m just happy we have beautiful healthy pups and eventually we’ll see if they look like daddy,” she said, laughing.

If you believe that you own one of the vehicles listed below, we encourage you to call Ford Customer Service at 800-392-3673 or Lincoln Customer Service at 800-521-4140 for additional details. Recall notices will be sent to owners of affected vehicles by mail. RECALL #1: 2011-2012 Ford F-150, 2012 Ford Expedition, Ford Mustang, and Lincoln Navigator UNITS AFFECTED: 201,900, including 184,000 in the U.S. and 17,900 in Canada This recall stems from a transmission problem--specifically, an issue with the output speed sensor on the transmission's lead frame. The underlying problem appears rooted in the software associated with the powertrain control module, which could cause vehicles to downshift suddenly. According to Ford: "Under certain conditions, the transmission controls could force a temporary downshift into first gear. Depending on the speed of the vehicle at the time of the downshift, the driver could experience an abrupt speed reduction that could cause the rear tires to slide or lock up. This condition could result in loss of vehicle control, increasing the risk of a crash." CHECK OUT: Jeep Renegade Vs.

Ford says that dealers will inspect the powertrain control module and upgrade the software if there are no diagnostic trouble codes found. The upgrade will prevent the vehicles from downshifting into first gear if a fault with the output speed sensor takes place. Ford also says that it will replace the lead frame on vehicles that have logged fewer than 150,000 miles. The recall is limited to vehicles equipped with 6R80 transmissions that were manufactured on the following dates: 2011-2012 Ford F-150 vehicles built at Dearborn Assembly Plant and Kansas City Assembly Plant between August 19, 2011 and March 9, 2012 2012 Ford Expedition vehicles built at Kentucky Truck Plant between August 19, 2011 and December 19, 2011 2012 Ford Mustang vehicles built at Flat Rock Assembly Plant between August 19, 2011 and February 21, 2012 2012 Lincoln Navigator vehicles built at Kentucky Truck Plant between August 19, 2011 and December 17, 2011 RECALL #2: 2014-2015 Ford Explorer and Ford Police Interceptor Utility UNITS AFFECTED: 81,036, including 75,364 in the U.S., 4,615 in Canada, and 1,057 in Mexico This recall is meant to address a problem with the SUVs' suspension systems.

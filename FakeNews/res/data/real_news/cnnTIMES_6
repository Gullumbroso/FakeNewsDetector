A Soft, Rosy Complexion

Natural or not, today’s most popular beauty products often feature packaging so sleek that the bathroom they live in (and the beauty regimen itself) can feel nearly clinical. But a bottle of Diptyque’s facial oil is as pleasing and romantic as a French rose — little dried petals of which float inside to continually perfume and infuse the formula over time. Plus, the oil is so lightweight, nourishing and not oily, that it primes skin nicely for a smooth makeup application (especially in winter). $70, diptyqueparis.com — ALAINNA LEXIE BEDDIE

Superpowered Suitcases

Over the holidays, I took off on a two-week trip — with multiple destinations and variegated clothing requirements — with just a carry-on. I fretted a bit, but needn’t have: the carry-on in question was the ridiculously handsome offering from the newish brand Arlo Skye, which was co-founded last year by an LVMH alum and a former head of design at Tumi. It’s a pretty, durable hardshell (I prefer the Champagne color) with a couple of genius upgrades. The closures are TSA-approved combination locks, rather than the zipper you can’t ever get closed. And most importantly, there’s a USB power bank built right into the handle. It was a lifesaver when a four-hour delay necessitated a mobile "Vanderpump Rules" marathon. $550, arloskye.com. — ALEXANDRIA SYMONDS

Jewelry That’s So Simple and Elegant

The designer Jameel Mohammed started the jewelry line Khiry in 2015, while in his junior year at the University of Pennsylvania, studying political science. The bracelets and rings in his first collection were clean and unadorned — like gestural brush strokes worn across a wrist or finger. The two I like the most are the Khartoum ring and bangle, which were inspired by cattle herded by the Dinka tribe of Sudan — which is a constant source of inspiration for Mohammed. “I wanted to celebrate the central importance of the cattle within the Dinka community by putting the silhouette at the center of KHIRY’s first collection,” he says. The selection also includes elegant hoops and drop earrings with precious stones. $295-$495, khiry.com. — ISABEL WILKINSON

The Book to Help You (Always) Shop Like a Local

On trips abroad, I usually scour Instagram for ideas on where to shop — to often frustrating results (stores always look better on Instagram than they do in real life). But with Booth Moore’s new book, “Where Stylists Shop,” I no longer feel the need. Organized by city, the book is a compendium of the best stores around the world and the stylish people who love them. It recommends everything from the best place to buy ceramics in San Miguel De Allende (Ceramica Lopez) to cheap jewelry in Mumbai (Tribe by Amrapali), to the wares of emerging African designers in Accra (Elle Lokko). There are recommendations from cool locals, too — including where the designer Vanessa Seward finds vintage gloves in Paris (Gants Muriel) or where Rodarte’s Kate Mulleavy got her favorite jean jacket in L.A. (Virgil Normal). One fun pro tip: Rachel Comey buys her plates at the museum. “My friend Leanne just turned me on to the tin plates at the Frick Collection,” the designer writes in the book. “Such a beautiful alternative to the disposable plates or carrying your heavy ceramics outside for a picnic.” $24.95, reganarts.com. — ISABEL WILKINSON

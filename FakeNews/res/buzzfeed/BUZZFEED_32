This Really Happened: Trump Met With Obama In The White House
Donald Trump met with President Obama at the White House Thursday to kick off the presidential transition process.

Obama said the meeting was “excellent” and wide-ranging, covering foreign and domestic policy.

Obama and Trump — who had never met in person before Thursday — talked for more than an hour.

“My No. 1 priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensured our president elect is successful,” Obama told reporters afterward. “And I have been very encouraged by the I think interest in President-elect Trump’s wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country face.”

First lady Michelle Obama also met with Melania Trump and “had an excellent conversation with her as well,” Obama said.

Trump also praised the meeting, saying it was an honor.

“We discussed a lot of different situations,” Trump said. “Some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel.”

He later tweeted that the two had “great chemistry.”
